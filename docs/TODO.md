# Things that need to be done to make this project future proof

* There should be PHPUnit tests
* The creation of the _ndx table entries relies on the client using
the interface correctly and creating them entirely. A default algorithm
should provide the _ndx table entries whenever an entries is crated or changed.
* make use of enhanced (proprietary) SQL to do real XPaht processing or
* limit the result using SQL and then filter that using \DOMXPatth
